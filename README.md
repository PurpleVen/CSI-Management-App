## Why do we need CSI management app?

Every organisation has a few key factors and objectives which make it specialise in its own way. From brainstorming ideas to reaching the goal, proper systematic construction of ideation, proposals and responsibilities create an overall functioning of the organisation.

However, there are limitations, when there isn't a standard base for all plans and suggestions to be maintained. Since the information that is stored plays an important role not only for the members to oversee details but also for the team to propose their event ideas, attendance, editing reports, requesting permissions and for the future core teams.

## Features 

| Activities that the functional app will be able to perform |  Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `Proposing events` | The CSI core team will be able to propose the event ideas which will be approved/rejected by the SBC and higher staff |
| `Assigning tasks` | Assignment of tasks can be done in the app, so that the faculty/members can check the resourced person for the task |
| `Recording attendance` | Each member can request their attendance mentioning the lecture and time slot that they missed which will be verified before approving/rejecting it  |
| `Activity reports` | All event reports are available wrt the events conducted by CSI for ease of access |

## The problems that are solved by this app include:

Making the work of completing tasks more easier as we do not need to go through multiple platforms to access and store data, from submitting proposals to getting it reviewed, itâ€™ll be a hassle-free process.

Leads to less time investment as higher authorities are just a click away to know about the documentations and ideas of the team , and it also provides the environment where nobody from the team misses out on anything as all the meeting details are visible to everyone.

Attendance is made less complicated as each member can mark their roll call through the app which can be verified by the authorities.
